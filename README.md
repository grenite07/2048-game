# 🎮 2048 Game in JavaScript

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my implementation of the classic **2048 game**, built step‑by‑step in **VS Code**.  
Inspired by a GeeksforGeeks project, I started from the basics and documented my work line‑by‑line to make it beginner‑friendly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML (index.html)** → Game board structure  
- **CSS (style.css)** → Styling, grid design, and animations  
- **JavaScript (script.js)** → Game logic (tile movement, merging, scoring, win/lose conditions)  

---

## 📷 Screenshots
I’ve added **7 screenshots** to show my journey from basics to the final game:
